Write the SQL code to create a table called Student. The table structure is summarised in the table below.


 INSERT INTO Student
    VALUES ("01", "Snow", "Jon", "E", "2014-04-05", "201", 6),
           ("02", "Stark", "Arya", "C", "2017-07-12", "305", 110),
           ("03", "Lannister", "Jamie", "C", "2012-09-05", "101", 2),
           ("04", "Lannister", "Cercei", "J", "2012-09-05", "101", 2), 
           ("05", "Greyjoy", "Theon", "I", "2015-12-09", "402", 14),
	       ("06", "Tyrell", "Margaery", "Y", "2017-07-12", "305", 10), 
	       ("07", "Baratheon", "Tommen", "R", "2019-06-13", "201", 5);

● Write the SQL code that will return all records which have a COURSE_CODE of 305.
● Write the SQL code to change the course code to 304 for the person whose student number is 07.
● Write the SQL code to delete the row of the person named Jamie Lannister, who started on 5 September 2012, whose course code is 101 and project number is 2. Use logical operators to include all of the information given in this problem.
● Write the SQL code that will change the PROJ_NUM to 14 for all those students who started before 1 January 2016 and whose course code is at least 201.
● Write the SQL code that will delete the Student table entirely.
